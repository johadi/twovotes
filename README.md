# My SocialVoting
One of the hardest and very challenged projects in NodeJS that I worked on in 2016.

This is a social application fully coded in NodeJs that allows users to compare two pictures posted by another user and they vote on the ones they like. working perfectly well but still requires a lot of update and enhancement which i do work on once in a while.

To use this project effectively one has to create two folders in the root directory(Voting).
These folders should be named uploads and resized_pictures.
after that, NPM install and there you go!
